pie-chart
=========


I should really do docs but its really just 

```
  (pie-chart-pict 110 '(#("Eggs" 1.5) #(Bacon 2.5) #(Pancakes 3.5)) #:colours '("orange" "pink" "green"))
  (pie-chart-pict 110 '(#(Eggs 7.5) #(Bacon 2.5) #(Pancakes 3.5) #("Beans" 2.5) #(Sausages 0.5)) #:colours '("red" "green" "blue" "pink" "orange"))

```

no legend you have to roll your own
